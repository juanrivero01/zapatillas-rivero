    detail: "The Men’s Air Jordan 1 Mid is the mid-top edition of the iconic Air Jordan 1 silhouette. Michael Jordan’s first signature shoe from 1985 was remodeled in this form in the early 2000s as an alternative for those who love the look of the famous sneaker but prefer a slightly lower height. The Air Jordan 1 Mid simply replicates the classic look of the Air Jordan 1 High with a lower collar height. The model is traditionally constructed in full-grain leather, with select styles featuring other materials including suede, nubuck, synthetic leather, and textiles. All of the details you know and love from the original AJ1 design are present, including the classic “Wings” Air Jordan logo, side Swooshes, and low-profile rubber cupsole. The Air Jordan 1 Mid releases in its own colorway options that often complement the high-top’s styles, as well as other Air Jordan retro models from time to time."
